# Phase 2 — Model: Swin-UNETR with Lp-QKNorm

## Goal

Produce a drop-in generalization of the QKNorm attention mechanism
(*Henry et al., 2020, arXiv:2010.04245*) based on the Lp norm
(*López-Rubio et al., 2026, arXiv:2602.05006*), and splice it into the
windowed self-attention of MONAI's `SwinUNETR` in a way that is
**numerically identical to the original QKNorm when `p = 2`** and
architecturally unchanged everywhere else.

The model must support both `spatial_dims=2` (2D slice-level training) and
`spatial_dims=3` (3D volume-level training). The Phase 1 standardized HDF5
stores complete 3D volumes; the DataModule's `spatial_mode` determines
which input shape the model receives. The attention patching logic is
identical for both — only the `SwinUNETR` constructor argument changes.

This phase contains no training. It produces a module that is exercised by
unit tests in isolation and in integration with a frozen-weights forward
pass.

## Mathematical specification

Let `X ∈ ℝ^{B × n × d}` be the input to a window of size `W` after the
standard Swin partitioning, so `n = W²`. For each head `h` with per-head
dimension `d_k`:

```
Q = X W_Q,   K = X W_K,   V = X W_V,        Q, K, V ∈ ℝ^{B × n × d_k}

||v||_p = (Σ_{h=1}^{d_k} |v_h|^p)^(1/p),     p ≥ 1

q̂_i^(p) = q_i / (||q_i||_p + ε)
k̂_j^(p) = k_j / (||k_j||_p + ε)

s_ij^(p) = α · ⟨q̂_i^(p), k̂_j^(p)⟩

A = softmax(S^(p) + B_rel),     output = A V
```

where `α` is a learnable positive scalar (parameterised as
`α = softplus(α_raw)` to enforce positivity without a hard constraint),
`ε = 1e-6` is an intrinsic-safety epsilon, and `B_rel` is Swin's relative
position bias (unchanged — this is attached after the dot product, not
absorbed into Q/K).

**Gradient note.** The `Lp` norm is non-differentiable at `v = 0` for
`p < 2`. Training regularly produces small-norm vectors, so we add `ε` inside
the norm computation and use the numerically stable form:

```
||v||_p = (Σ_h (|v_h| + ε)^p)^(1/p)   for p < 2
||v||_p = (Σ_h |v_h|^p + ε)^(1/p)     for p ≥ 2
```

The sweep range `p ∈ [2, 4]` sits in the latter regime, so the simpler form
applies, but the module must handle `p < 2` for unit tests and ablations.

## Open questions the agent must resolve before coding

1. **Which class in MONAI holds the windowed attention for SwinUNETR**.
   Inspect both `monai.networks.nets.SwinUNETR(spatial_dims=2, ...)` and
   `SwinUNETR(spatial_dims=3, ...)` at runtime, walk the module tree, and
   identify the attention module. Confirm the same `WindowAttention` class
   is used for both spatial dims (expected). As of MONAI ≥ 1.3.0 this should
   be `monai.networks.blocks.patchembedding.WindowAttention` or equivalent
   in `monai.networks.blocks.selfattention`. **Confirm**, do not assume.
2. **The exact signature of that attention's forward pass**, specifically
   how it handles `qkv` projection, scaling (typically `head_dim ** -0.5`),
   softmax, and relative position bias. Record the canonical
   input/output shapes in a docstring comment at the top of
   `models/attention.py`.
3. **Whether relative position biases are registered per-layer or shared**.
   This determines whether replacing the module per-layer preserves learned
   biases across layers.
4. **The simplest patching strategy**: (a) subclass + monkey-patch module
   tree after construction, or (b) copy the MONAI source once, paste into
   this repo under `models/_monai_vendored.py` with provenance comment, and
   modify the attention class directly. The agent should choose based on
   MONAI's API stability; document the decision in `models/swin_unetr_lp.py`.
   Prefer (a) if feasible; vendor only if MONAI internals resist clean
   substitution.

```

Hooks must store references (not `.clone()`) during forward, then clone and
detach inside `captures()` to avoid keeping the autograd graph alive when
probing in `torch.inference_mode()`.

## Design notes

**Why `softplus(α_raw)` instead of `exp(α_raw)`.** Softplus is better
conditioned near zero and has bounded gradients for large negative inputs.
The original QKNorm paper is not explicit on parameterisation; `softplus` is
the safer default.

**Why preserve the relative position bias.** Removing it would conflate two
effects (Lp normalization and positional geometry). This is an ablation for
a future paper, not for this one.

**Why `eps` inside the norm**. Without it, lesion tokens that happen to
produce near-zero feature vectors at initialization would produce infinite
gradients on the first few steps, preventing training. The toy-model
prediction of an interior maximum at `p* ∈ (2, 4)` does not depend on `eps`
for `ε ≪ min_h |v_h|`.

**Why hooks rather than modifying the attention's return values.** Keeping
the forward signature identical to MONAI's original class means the rest of
SwinUNETR is unaware of the modification — important both for correctness
and for future ablations where the hook-based probe collection should work
on the stock MONAI model for baseline measurements.

## Implementation checklist

1. `models/lp_qknorm.py`:
   - `LpQKNormConfig` dataclass (frozen, typed).
   - `LpQKNorm` module with `p` as a buffer (not parameter) and `alpha_raw`
     as the only learnable parameter.
   - Private helper `_lp_normalize(x, p, eps, dim=-1)` with the
     numerically stable form described above. Unit-test this in isolation.
2. `models/attention.py`:
   - Replicate MONAI's `WindowAttention` interface (same `__init__` args,
     same `forward(x, mask)` signature, same output shape).
   - Replace the `attn = (q @ k.transpose(-2, -1)) * scale` line with the
     Lp-normalised analogue.
   - Keep all other code paths identical: qkv projection, head splitting,
     relative position bias addition, softmax, attention dropout, proj,
     proj dropout.
3. `models/swin_unetr_lp.py`:
   - Construct MONAI `SwinUNETR(spatial_dims=2, ...)`.
   - Walk the module tree, identify every `WindowAttention` instance,
     replace with `LpWindowAttention` preserving the learned weights
     (`W_qkv`, `proj`, relative position bias) from the freshly
     constructed MONAI module.
   - Return the patched model.
4. `models/hooks.py`:
   - `AttentionHookRegistry` with `register_forward_hook` on every
     `LpWindowAttention` at specified stages.
   - Capture `q`, `k`, normalised versions, final attention, and `alpha`.
5. Expose all of the above via `src/lpqknorm/models/__init__.py`.

## Acceptance tests

All in `tests/unit/test_lp_qknorm.py`,
`tests/unit/test_attention_equivalence.py`,
`tests/integration/test_forward_pass.py`.

### 1. `LpQKNorm` basic properties

```python
def test_lp_norm_unit_length():
    x = torch.randn(4, 16, 64)  # B, n, d_k
    for p in [1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 8.0]:
        cfg = LpQKNormConfig(p=p)
        module = LpQKNorm(cfg)
        q_hat, _, _ = module(x, x)
        norms = q_hat.abs().pow(p).sum(-1).pow(1.0 / p)
        assert torch.allclose(norms, torch.ones_like(norms), atol=1e-4)
```

### 2. **Critical equivalence test**: `p = 2` recovers original QKNorm

Construct a reference `RefQKNorm` implementing Henry et al.'s formulation
exactly:

```python
q_hat_ref = q / (q.norm(p=2, dim=-1, keepdim=True) + eps)
k_hat_ref = k / (k.norm(p=2, dim=-1, keepdim=True) + eps)
logits_ref = alpha * (q_hat_ref @ k_hat_ref.transpose(-2, -1))
```

Then assert `torch.allclose(LpQKNorm(p=2)(q, k)[0], q_hat_ref, atol=1e-5)`
over 100 random inputs. This is the single most important test in the repo.
If it fails, every downstream claim about "`p = 2` is the QKNorm baseline"
is false.

### 3. Monotone norm ordering

For fixed `x`, `||x||_p` is non-increasing in `p`. Test that
`||LpQKNorm.lp_normalize(x, p=1).norm(p=1) >= ...norm(p=2) >= ...norm(p=4)`
up to numerical tolerance on 50 random vectors.

### 4. Gradient flow at the edge

Verify that `torch.autograd.gradcheck` passes for `_lp_normalize` with
`p ∈ {1.5, 2.0, 3.0}` on double-precision inputs of shape `(4, 8, 16)`
with `eps = 1e-6`. Skip `p = 1.0` (non-differentiable at zero crossings;
not in the sweep).

### 5. Drop-in compatibility (2D and 3D)

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("spatial_dims,img_size,x_shape", [
    (2, (224, 224), (2, 1, 224, 224)),
    (3, (96, 96, 96), (1, 1, 96, 96, 96)),
])
def test_attention_shape_preserved(spatial_dims, img_size, x_shape):
    model_stock = monai.networks.nets.SwinUNETR(
        img_size=img_size, in_channels=1, out_channels=1,
        feature_size=24, spatial_dims=spatial_dims,
    )
    model_lp = build_swin_unetr_lp(
        img_size=img_size, in_channels=1, out_channels=1,
        feature_size=24, spatial_dims=spatial_dims,
        lp_cfg=LpQKNormConfig(p=3.0),
    )
    x = torch.randn(*x_shape)
    assert model_stock(x).shape == model_lp(x).shape
```

### 6. Weight transfer integrity

When patching, the `W_qkv`, `proj`, and relative position biases must equal
those of the freshly constructed stock model:

```python
def test_weights_transferred():
    stock = monai.networks.nets.SwinUNETR(...)
    patched = build_swin_unetr_lp(..., lp_cfg=LpQKNormConfig(p=2.0))
    for (_, stock_mod), (_, patched_mod) in zip(
        find_attentions(stock), find_attentions(patched)
    ):
        assert torch.equal(stock_mod.qkv.weight, patched_mod.qkv.weight)
        assert torch.equal(
            stock_mod.relative_position_bias_table,
            patched_mod.relative_position_bias_table,
        )
```

### 7. Hook capture test

```python
def test_hooks_capture_expected_tensors():
    model = build_swin_unetr_lp(..., lp_cfg=LpQKNormConfig(p=3.0))
    registry = AttentionHookRegistry()
    registry.register(model, stages=[0])
    with torch.inference_mode():
        _ = model(torch.randn(1, 1, 224, 224))
    captures = registry.captures()
    assert len(captures) >= 1  # at least one stage-0 block
    for c in captures:
        assert c.q.shape == c.k.shape
        assert c.q_hat.shape == c.q.shape
        assert c.attention.shape[-1] == c.attention.shape[-2]  # square
        norm = c.q_hat.abs().pow(3.0).sum(-1).pow(1/3.0)
        assert torch.allclose(norm, torch.ones_like(norm), atol=1e-3)
```

### 8. **Interior-maximum sanity check on synthetic input**

Build a controlled test input matching the toy model from the design
discussion: `s = 4, d_k = 64`, one query aligned with lesion, two keys
(lesion-like peaky, background-like diffuse). Compute the logit gap
`Δ(p) = s_{q,k_L} - s_{q,k_B}` for `p ∈ {1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 8}` and assert
the empirical maximum lies at `p* ∈ {3, 4}`. This connects the implementation
to the theoretical prediction and catches sign errors early.
